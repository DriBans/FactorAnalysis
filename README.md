### FactorAnalysis

`Factor analysis is a technique that is used to reduce a large number of variables into fewer numbers of factors. This technique extracts maximum common variance from all variables and puts them into a common score. As an index of all variables, we can use this score for further analysis.`

I am to run a factor analysis on the variables and develop a report of findings. Please go to [Factor Analysis report](https://github.com/DriBans/FactorAnalysis/blob/main/assign1DB.pdf)
